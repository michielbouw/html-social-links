##Usage

Use the html code as it is in the html file. Also use the bottom references to the js file and use a version of jquery (checked jquery >1.8).

Copy the style part of the html file to your own .css style file or place it in your file at the top in the head section too.

Copy the js file to your directory, also in a map js (or change the bottom link).

Then it will work properly.
